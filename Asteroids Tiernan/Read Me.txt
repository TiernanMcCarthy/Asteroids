Note

Collisions do work, they do not until you press a button on the keyboard to stop the player being killed in their spawn repeatedly.

These collisions are not perfect, as they are just a circular bound around the object, they are the main issue.

The game will loop contiously if you lose or win, your lives are shown after you are hit in the game, but in the console window. 

This was not made to be a game, this was a demonstration at University.
